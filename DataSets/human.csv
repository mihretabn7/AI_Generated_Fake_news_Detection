"In his review of Ted Gioia’s “Music: A Subversive History” (Jan. 12), David Hajdu reminds us that the works of the great composers often puzzled or even infuriated the listeners of their time. I’d like to recommend a book that illustrates some of this frustration. Nicolas Slonimsky’s “A Lexicon of Musical Invective” is a collection of bad (even scathing) reviews of great classical works. Many seem little more than opportunities for the reviewers to show off their witticisms, and we still see that today.

"That Saturday in Doylestown, Andy Meehan was eager to continue sharing his own reasons. After his rally, he and a few voters fled the snowfall and ducked into a coffee shop.

"Van Hove read the song’s comedy as dark truth, and he was staging it as an autobiography of kids who have been abused and neglected. The Jets and the Sharks, he observed, are products of an inhumane system — of immigration laws, of racism, of policing. “Krupke” would become an indictment.",0

"When I arrived in the poor, remote Bosnian village where Ratko Mladic grew up, it was covered with blacks crows. It was somehow fitting for the hometown of the Bosnian-Serb general held responsible for the massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. In 2010, I and another Times reporter, Doreen Carvajal, investigated his whereabouts. He was captured one year later, in a Serbian farming village. His conviction in November 2017 for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes marked the end of one of Europe’s bloodiest chapters since the end of World War II.",0

"Professor Christensen’s formula was elegant: “First, disruptive products are simpler and cheaper; they generally promise lower margins, not greater profits. Second, disruptive technologies typically are first commercialized in emerging or insignificant markets.

"Weeks after the massacre, on New Year’s Eve, the Germans came to the ghetto and demanded a small force of boys to keep a fire going in the governor’s mansion, where German officers were celebrating the holiday. They needed the youths to keep the pipes from freezing. Lisa said there were three boys, Rae recalled there were twenty. But they both agree on the outlines of the story: That the boys, their sixteen-year-old brother Chanon among them, were tending the fire when a drunken German decided to entertain the party by demanding the boys raise their arms and say “Heil Hitler.” Then he shot them. Chanon took a bullet in the leg and fell back on the fire, where he remained while the Germans checked the boys for signs of life. Burnt and shot, he was able to crawl out of the Nazi mansion, where he was found (Lisa said by some boys on a work assignment, Rae said by their mother) and smuggled back into the ghetto in a wheelbarrow full of straw. Hidden for months, he was able to recover.",0

When they first brought up the question of the virus in Wuhan, I have to admit that my reaction was basically to reassure them, in line with all the official reassurances, and then to ask how many of them had gotten their annual flu shots.

"Another way to weigh the pros and cons of dried fruit is to look at glycemic load, a measure of how fast your body converts a serving of food into sugar. Ideally you should eat foods with a glycemic load of 10 or less. Anything above 20 is considered very high. Prunes have a glycemic load of 10, whereas raisins have a glycemic load of 28. Compare that to whole fruits. Strawberries, apricots, grapefruit, lemon, limes, cantaloupe, nectarines, oranges, pears, blueberries, peaches, plums, apples and pineapple have glycemic loads of 6 or less.",0

"In theory, figuring out how to answer these questions should be the province of the world’s regulatory agencies, and most scientists agree that gene drives will need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, akin to how the Food and Drug Administration evaluates the safety of a new treatment or pharmaceutical. But regulating a technology that doesn’t stop at the border of a country or a state is a new problem. Unlike a chemical pesticide, gene drives are inherently mobile — able to cross borders or potentially even oceans. And while some species, like the malaria-carrying Anopheles gambiae mosquito, exist only in sub-Saharan Africa, others, like the Norway rat, are virtually everywhere. As Kuiken put it: “How do you regulate a technology that’s undetectable, self-propagating and can fly? If one community doesn’t want it, does that mean that the other four or five communities around it aren’t allowed to move forward? How do you set up an international governance regime that enables you to make those kinds of decisions? So far, I haven’t seen any proposals that get us there.”",0

After 1980, though, the numbers began dropping. By 1992, the opposing party was down to 40; by 1998, it had fallen to 38; in 2016, it was down to 29.

"A small team sifted through Trump’s personal and corporate financial records and tax returns. The first thing the bankers noticed was that Trump was, once again, vastly overstating his fortune, assigning absurdly high valuations to his real estate assets. In one especially egregious case, he claimed that a property he bought in Westchester County for about $7 million was now worth $291 million. The bank ended up reducing the assets’ values by as much as 70 percent.",0
"In the aftermath of the attack, some in El Paso feared that copycat anti-Latino shootings would strike the city. As a result, several Hispanic residents and survivors sought to protect themselves — buying firearms, target-practicing at shooting ranges and applying for state-issued licenses to carry handguns.",0
"‘THE THIN PLACE’ at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Jan. 26). Lucas Hnath’s ghost story, directed by Les Waters, turns out the lights. Centered on a young woman who believes in other worlds and a medium who maybe doesn’t, the play, Jesse Green wrote, “presses against the deepest human longings not only for connection but also for exposure.” He added, “We want to know what’s out there, yes, but we also want it to know us.”",0

"Last year’s winner in this category, “Skin,” was an English-language short with recognizable actors that culminated in an obvious but effective twist. That pretty much describes this year’s front-runner, “The Neighbors’ Window,” which stars the Tony nominee Maria Dizzia as a harried New York mom who envies the young, glamorous couple in the apartment across the way until … well, I won’t spoil it. Though I found the eventual twist rather trite, it’s exactly the sort of thing that clicks with Oscar voters, and Dizzia is so committed that you’re inclined to just go with it.",0

Two men eating lunch on a concrete step said they liked the quiet but worried what might happen during sports games when traffic gets thick.

"Mr. Shannon said that the fuel costs for a diesel bus were about 85 cents per mile, as opposed to 19 cents for an electric bus, depending on “how well the driver drives and whether he or she takes advantage of the regenerative braking,” the process in which braking itself creates energy that is accessible for the vehicle. Some are “keeping their costs as low 16-17 cents per mile. Except for a few who drive with a lead foot,” he added. In addition, because electric buses have fewer parts, maintenance is less costly. Yet, despite these savings, because school buses do not travel as much as municipal transit buses, it can take years to recoup the additional cost of an electric vehicle.",0
"But after living in Latin America over the course of five decades, I have seen too few sustained efforts to create paths of social mobility that are secure and stable. Undoing that trend demands not only sound growth and redistribution policies, but also the opening up of greater access to economic and political power, breaking the nexus between private interests and the political class, and attaining equal justice under the law. At the dawn of a new decade, that urgent cry can be heard on streets throughout Latin America.",0

Most come from owners who need modest sums of money quickly and may not be able to get a regular unsecured loan; some are brought by those who need the money more than the goods and can’t find a better place to sell them. Those sellers, of course, aren’t planning to recover their items.",0
"Crucially, it also means Mr. Gantz will be able to fly back to Israel in time to oversee a key proceeding Tuesday regarding Mr. Netanyahu’s attempt to obtain parliamentary immunity from prosecution on serious corruption charges.

"The president brought a deal maker’s swagger and a property developer’s instincts to a problem that, after all, involves disputed territory. His close ties to Mr. Netanyahu — something Mr. Obama lacked — raised hopes that he might be able to extract real concessions from Israel. In a sign of the importance Mr. Trump attached to the effort, he put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of it.",0
"Mr. Romney is also an oddity among Senate Republicans in that he has not withheld his low opinion of Mr. Trump. “He has made a career of trashing people by tweet,” Mr. Romney said in response to a question about what he thought of an outburst from the president on Wednesday morning about John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, whose unpublished manuscript contains an account that contradicts Mr. Trump’s impeachment defense. “It is part of his shtick and it’s working for him,” he said of the Twitter attack. “I think it’s unfortunate.”",0

"Barnes recorded and released albums by a stable of lesser-known and emerging vocalists and songwriters — Love Joys, Milton Henry, Junior Delahaye, Annette Brissett and Prince Douglas — all backed by his mighty studio band, the six-piece Wackie’s Rhythm Force. On the early hip-hop single “Wack Rap” by Solid C., Bobby D. and Kool Drop, Barnes experimented with styles that demonstrated the Bronx’s swirl of influences at the time, combining M.C.s with a disco beat and elements of dub production. His innovations appealed to artists in other genres, too: The dub techno innovators Moritz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus started reissuing Wackie’s records on their Basic Channel label in 2001.",0

"Mr. Trump’s speech at the National Prayer Breakfast was as overtly political as any president has delivered at the annual event, traditionally a bipartisan affair marked by talk of faith and common ground.

"Pitt should have been nominated this year for best actor for his delicate, deep work in James Gray’s “Ad Astra,” a meditation on the unbearable weight of masculinity set largely in outer space. The film was praised as was Pitt’s turn, but neither found awards momentum. The performance was too good and certainly too subtle and interiorized for the academy. It has a historic weakness for showboating — the more suffering the better — which is why Joaquin Phoenix (often otherwise worthy) and his jutting rib cage in “Joker” seem like a lock. But Pitt has time. It took seven nominations for Paul Newman to win best actor; Redford has been nominated only once for acting (he lost).",0

Zilberman gives the movie an extra charge by fluidly interweaving scenes of the dramatized Amir with news clips of political speeches and rallies from the time — the sort of rallies at which posters might show Rabin’s face caught in cross hairs. The overall sense is that, with conditions set, incitement is an easy, even passive process — and that Amir’s murder of Rabin is not only a tragedy, but also a cautionary tale.",0

"Although the A.C.L.U.’s “colorblind logic” might be effective as a matter of litigation strategy — assuming that a male plaintiff can be substituted for a female, a Jehovah’s Witness for a Santerían, a white supremacist for a civil rights activist, because the liberties, once won, will be available to all — this civil libertarian approach can yield problematic results given entrenched structural inequalities. This may be particularly true of the A.C.L.U.’s most controversial current position (at least among liberals): its insistence that corporations are entitled to the same political speech rights as individual citizens, and that spending money in elections is a protected form of speech. I was disappointed not to see Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission — possibly the most notorious Supreme Court case of the millennium — among the cases selected for discussion here, particularly since, in recent years, it’s been increasingly difficult to find mention of the A.C.L.U.’s role in Citizens United or its continuing opposition to campaign finance reform efforts. (A disclaimer here: At the Brennan Center for Justice, where I directed the Money in Politics project, I often litigated and advocated against the A.C.L.U. in its challenges to campaign finance laws, including in Citizens United, where I was counsel of record on a Supreme Court amicus brief supporting the F.E.C.) But I still count myself as a supporter of the A.C.L.U., as does Scott Turow, even though his essay on Buckley v. Valeo (the progenitor to the Citizens United line of cases) excoriates the A.C.L.U. for its position on campaign finance reform and even suggests that the A.C.L.U. “hides from its own actions out of apparent fear of diminishing its contributor base.” Given that this book so often lauds the A.C.L.U. for its defense of unpopular causes, it’s troubling that the A.C.L.U.’s own most unpopular recent case gets such short shrift.",0

"First, a vote to subpoena witnesses would strike at the heart of the president’s efforts — which continue to this day — to impede his own removal from office. Earlier attempts by leaders in the House to complete a detailed inquiry without waiting out the courts on the issue of witnesses fell flat. Admittedly, they had good reasons to move on. As Jerry Nadler explained, it took eight months to get a Federal District Court to say that Don McGahn cannot ignore a congressional subpoena, and it could have taken eight more for a final judgment affirming that ruling on appeal.",0

"The first time I saw M.B.Z., last May, he was at his evening majlis, a central ritual of Emirati social and political life. It was in a vast reception hall in Abu Dhabi, and I was surrounded by hundreds of fasting Muslims. It was over 100 degrees outside, but this palatial room, with its 50-foot ceilings and rows of immense chandeliers, was air-conditioned to a clammy-palms chill, like almost every other building in the U.A.E. It was strange to be surrounded by so many Emiratis, who form a small minority of the country’s population. I’ve been visiting the U.A.E. for many years, and have come to think of rootlessness as one of the country’s defining features. Even when the streets are packed, almost everyone you see in Dubai or Abu Dhabi — a Benetton crowd of faces from everywhere on Earth — comes from somewhere else. When you ask them about their lives, they almost invariably mention how grateful they are to be in the U.A.E., sending cash home to their families in Kerala or Nairobi or Kuala Lumpur.",0

Black music has never been respected by the Grammys to the point that it should be,” he said. “For years we’ve allowed institutions that have never had our best interests at heart to judge us. And that stops right now.” He issued a challenge to the Recording Academy to make radical changes in the next year, and urged his fellow artists and executives to be part of the evolution. And if things don’t change, Diddy’s predictions were dire: “We have the power. We decide what’s hot. If we don’t go, nobody goes. We don’t support, nobody supports.” JON CARAMANICA",0

"Yes. President Trump’s first legislative priority after his election was to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act.

As John Green wrote of the first book in this trilogy (soon to be rounded out with a prequel, “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes”): “The considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins’s convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine.

(Ukraine has opened an investigation into Hyde’s activity, and on Thursday he was visited by the F.B.I.) A lawyer and Fox News regular named Victoria Toensing — who has represented a Kremlin-aligned Ukrainian oligarch who is, according to the Justice Department, an upper-echelon associate of Russian organized crime figures — texted Giuliani saying, “Is there absolute commitment for her to be gone this week?” Why the obsession with Yovanovitch?",0

By the time James entered his name in the draft in 2003, the league had no such qualms, due in no small measure to Bryant. James went No. 1 over all to the Cleveland Cavaliers.",0

"She always sent me home with a bag of her vintage hand-me-downs: pastel Tocca tank tops, a pink floral Agnès B. blouse. She was as generous as she was difficult, which is saying a lot. After our last visit, in November 2018, while I was in town on an extended layover en route to Morocco for another Playboy story, she gave me a graphite-colored silk dress by the British label Ghost, which now feels macabre.

"Early on, when it was clear that Biden would be attacked as the rickety embodiment of a bygone Democratic establishment, the campaign faced a dilemma. Biden could try to win over the burn-it-down activists and young voters who were said to be taking over the party; he could lurch leftward, sign on to progressive preoccupations like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal and basically try to remake himself in the image of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the person of a septuagenarian with a hair transplant.",0

"Mr. Sovern stayed in Minnesota for two years before returning to New York as a professor at Columbia Law. He was teaching there when student protests erupted in 1968, set off by Columbia’s involvement in weapons research during the Vietnam War and the university’s plan, opposed by many Harlem residents, to build a gymnasium in nearby Morningside Park. Soon, activists occupied five buildings, including the president’s office, and shut the campus down. Police arrested and removed the protesters in a violent melee.",0

If the players return to action and another episode of racist behavior occurs, the game will be ended as the third step of the protocol.",0
"THE BLACK CATHEDRAL, by Marcial Gala. Translated by Anna Kushner. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) In this tragicomic novel, a visionary preacher comes up against the grim realities of life in a Cuban backwater. Among its ensemble cast are accidental cannibals, angst-ridden ghosts and tenderhearted killers. “Even as the novel charts the voyages of its vagabonds, it represents an attempt to draw the periphery into the center,” Shaj Mathew writes in his review, “steering us toward the provinces as it renovates the Cuban novel.”",0

"Miller, an ambitious rapper with a groggy voice who evolved rapidly and sold millions of records before he died from an accidental overdose in September 2018, at 26, was an accomplished producer in his own right. But he enlisted Brion for what he hoped would be a creatively expansive and experimental new phase of his career. He’d hinted at as much on “Swimming,” the jazzy, kinetic album (on which Brion co-produced several tracks) released just a month before his death. But the scope of his vision, and of his budding partnership with Brion, became clear only Friday, with the posthumous release of a new album and counterpart to “Swimming” called “Circles.”",0

"Talented and charismatic, with a knack for rallying people, Davis was inclusive in his art and his life. He gathered his family and friends around him and refused to commit to a single figurative style or to use photographic images in a formulaic way.

"In both “The Convert” and his previous novel, the highly praised “War and Turpentine,” Hertmans habitually treats the reader to his process.

"The project wasn’t going very well. Genetic engineering is finicky work. Gantz started by fabricating a gene that caused the mutation for the missing vein; then he used a hair-thin glass needle to inject that into fly eggs, each the size of a grain of sand. The process worked, according to Gantz, roughly one time in a hundred. Even then, the resulting fly got only a single copy of the defective gene, and it took two to produce the missing vein. Because the gene was recessive, moreover, there was no way to tell just by looking which adult fly received it. Gantz’s only option was to blindly engineer, and crossbreed, scores of flies, in hopes that two carrying the recessive mutation would eventually find each other and mate. But so far, despite hundreds of hours of work, Gantz had failed to generate even a single mutated fly.",0

The Ethiopian airport itself was built in part with funding from China.",0
"“I did have some interest in Bernie Sanders, and I appreciate him,” said Jennifer Schwartz, 47, an independent from Wolfeboro who said she was drawn to both Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Yang. “But as far as the message goes, what I hear from Bernie Sanders sounds a lot like class warfare.”",0

"“Ahlan Simsim,” which will air in Arabic and Kurdish, has two main characters. Both were built at Jim Henson’s Creature Shop in Queens, where rows of desks are covered with half-constructed muppets and older ones midrepair. (Muppets bigger than a desk — Mr. Snuffleupagus, for example — might lean against a wall.) Jordan Pioneers Production Company, based in Jordan, collaborated with Sesame Workshop to develop the characters, write scripts and shoot the episodes. When producers from “Sesame” made a series of visits to the Creature Shop last year to discuss muppet design and look at prototypes, Zaid Baqaeen and Khaled Haddad of Jordan Pioneers, the show’s head writer and an executive producer, joined from Amman via video chat.",0

"5. Nawang Gurung, a New York-based translator, talked about some of the reasons that Tibeto-Burman languages that were spoken in the Himalayas are disappearing. What are some of the factors that he describes as being part of the decline of Seke speakers and of other speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages?",0

I watched the most recent presidential debate and turned off the TV at the end with the same feeling I had after previous debates. I liked all the Democratic contenders but still have no favorite candidate. Most of my friends who are committed Democrats say the same thing: We’ll vote for anyone who can beat President Trump.,0

"“They see escalation as the only way to the negotiating table,” said Ms. Vakil. “They can’t capitulate and come to the negotiating table. They can’t compromise, because that would show weakness. By demonstrating that they can escalate, that they are fearless, they are trying to build leverage.”",0

"Could this category give us Sunday’s most delicious upset? My brain is telling me that DiCaprio should take the award easily: He’s an 11-time Globe nominee who has won three times before, and the Hollywood foreign press counts on his star wattage to keep their lights on every year. That said, “Rocketman” star Egerton has campaigned much more extensively than his reticent competitors, and though he’s hindered by the fact that his performance as Elton John comes in the shadow of Rami Malek’s Globe-winning “Bohemian Rhapsody” turn just last year, I can’t underestimate Egerton’s willingness to press the flesh. DiCaprio is probably safe, but oh man: If he loses, that reaction-shot GIF is gonna be brutal.",0

"Another part of the equation is that Iraq has been weakened by months of violent demonstrations, which have forced the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, setting off a power struggle. One target of the demonstrations has been the power wielded by Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and Kataib Hezbollah may have correctly gambled that provoking the United States into airstrikes inside Iraq would divert popular passions toward anti-American actions.",0
"After moving to the Ozarks in 1976, Mr. Wilson split his time between making art and raising beef cattle. The 1987 exhibit and other gallery shows rekindled his interest in posters, and for a time he published a journal on poster art and related subjects called Off the Wall.",0
"The groom, dapper in a black Ralph Lauren tuxedo, was escorted by his parents to the altar, and was followed a few minutes later by the bride, angelic in an Anne Barge wedding gown.

"Still other institutions have become dehumanized. Our schools, hospitals, prisons and welfare systems don’t embed people in thick relationships. They treat them as units to be processed and shoved out the door. Still other institutions cease to exist. Why do we still not have a national service program?",0

"When Phillips was told the oba couldn’t see him because a religious festival was taking place, he went anyway.",0
"Despite these significant expansions in CODIS, one constant has remained: Until now, CODIS’s crime-solving components have contained genetic profiles only of individuals connected with criminal activity, whether accused or convicted. Now, for the first time, CODIS will warehouse the genetic data of people who have not been accused of any crime, for crime detection purposes. Noncitizens in immigration custody are not criminals as a rule. The vast majority of immigration infractions that land an immigrant in detention are civil in nature, akin to the I.R.S. asking a citizen to pay a penalty when she fails to withhold enough money from her paycheck. And in the case of refugees seeking asylum (a large and increasing proportion of the detained noncitizen population), international and domestic law expressly allow these individuals to enter the United States to claim the right to refuge. By severing the longstanding prerequisite of prior (alleged) criminal conduct for compelled DNA collection, the government puts us all at risk.",0

"For Theresa Furrer, 45 of Nine Lives Twine spinning cat and dog hair into yarn and woven keepsakes has become a full-time job.

"“The manager of this new office at the time was Mr. Bob Haldeman,” Mr. Wilson wrote on his blog, “and it was probably either him or his assistant, Mr. Ron Ziegler, who originally spoke with me on the phone about it.” Both, of course, would soon be important figures in President Richard M. Nixon’s administration.",0
"Gloria Gaynor, the disco diva who won in 1980 for her anthem “I Will Survive,” took home her first award since then — best roots gospel album, for “Testimony.” Tracy Young became the first woman to win the best remixed recording category for a version of Madonna’s “I Rise.”",0

"The term “print” is a broad one, traditionally used to describe a number of types of original fine art works such as etchings, lithographs and woodcuts that are produced in limited editions through a range of processes. In each case, the artist creates an image and works with a publisher or printer to produce the set number, often destroying the plate, the stone or other matrix used after printing.",0
"Yet most of the insights Stern gleans from the information she collects are more banal than illuminating. Some examples: “Nationalism … starts wars”; ”one pathway to hatred is when a dominant ethnic group fears losing its status and privileges”; “stoking fear is a powerful weapon”; “fear and hatred, properly amplified, can lead to war”; “hate speech is effective at increasing prejudice.” Surely we know by now that demagogues exploit historical grievances and popular fears, often nationalist or racist in substance, to turn populations against one another.",0
"At Davos, President Trump said: “Honestly, we have all the material. They don’t have the material.” In doing so, he openly admitted to obstruction of justice. Case closed.",0

"Ms. Pelosi, having carefully orchestrated the impeachment vote in the House, does not want to allow the Senate to quickly bury the matter without delving into additional witness accounts or documents. And if she cannot force Mr. McConnell to agree to those terms, she is determined at least to convince the public that the Senate trial is illegitimate — and, by extension, that Mr. Trump’s acquittal was rigged from the start.",0

"But when another of the broadcaster’s stations, WDR2, picked up the song, it had a children’s choir sing it. It posted a video to its Facebook page on Dec. 27, comments were posted, and calls came in from people, many of them grandparents who felt offended.",0

"Sometimes significant films weren’t even intended for theaters. MoMA will hold the New York premiere of a restoration of “The Amusement Park,” an hourlong Romero feature from 1973 that has practically never been seen. Although Suzanne Desrocher-Romero, the widow of the “Night of the Living Dead” director, told me there were probably isolated screenings over the years, very few copies were known to exist, and the film was only made to be shown in community centers.",0
"Shoshana Chen, a survivor’s daughter, said in a radio interview that world leaders needed to do more than give lip service to fighting violence against Jews. “It’s not enough to say never again,” she said, adding: “The honorable Mr. Macron, what exactly is he doing to root out anti-Semitism in his country?

"Stern looked at the basketball court and saw the world’s greatest athletes, a unique, supersize group of players who could fly through the air on their way to twisting dunks and toss a large ball through a small hoop from 30 feet away. His league had rare talents like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, and, beginning in 1984, a guard out of North Carolina named Michael Jordan. Stern, who believed the N.B.A. had failed to leverage the talents and popularity of its past stars, decided that all N.B.A. greats, past and present, would be his tickets to success.",0

"San Francisco won the coin toss with Richard Sherman’s call of tails and the team deferred the choice. As a result, Kansas City will start with the ball and will defend the west end zone. (That directional makes more sense if you’re in the stadium but you’ll get the hang of it.)",0
"Still, regardless of whether it should inform any electoral strategy, these randomized profiles aren’t just a quirk of a single survey.

"And yet we blame ourselves for not being green enough. As the climate essayist Mary Annaïse Heglar writes, “The belief that this enormous, existential problem could have been fixed if all of us had just tweaked our consumptive habits is not only preposterous; it’s dangerous.” It turns eco-saints against eco-sinners, who are really just fellow victims. It misleads us into thinking that we have agency only by dint of our consumption habits — that buying correctly is the only way we can fight climate change.",0

"One of the problems that any gay writer faces is how to depict happiness. The drama lies often in the quality of the secrecy, the terms of the struggle, the nature of the loneliness, the manner in which all projects seem doomed. In a note written in 1960 on his novel “Maurice,” a book finished in 1914 but not published until 1971, E. M. Forster, who did not wish to create a tragic ending for his gay characters, wrote: “I was determined that in fiction anyway two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows.”",0
"With its ability to create powerful changes invisibly, genetic engineering can feel eerie to even the most rational of us. Brain-imaging studies of people who strongly oppose genetically modified foods show that simply imagining, say, eating a G.M.O. tomato will cause some people to have a powerful disgust response, as if they were being asked to eat worms. When I mentioned this to James, he seemed unsurprised. “People are sort of weird about genes,” he said with a shrug. “There’s a visceral fear. And it’s hard to talk people out of those sorts of fears.”",0
"Two years ago, I too was on the family side of this situation after my brother-in-law Pat collapsed with a brain hemorrhage from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. As the only physician in the family and Pat’s legally designated health care power of attorney, I made his medical decisions and communicated with the rest of his family, including his two sons, who were then 16 and 18 years old. This was all the more difficult because a year previously, his wife, my sister Victoria, had died of leukemia, leaving Pat as their children’s sole caregiver.",0

"Taking a victory lap for what he called the “sober and stable Senate,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, issued a stern rebuke of the House Democrats’ case and strategy, casting it as a politically motivated attack that amounted to the “most rushed, least fair and least thorough presidential impeachment inquiry in American history.”",0

"Yet while Gibney’s refusal to simplify his subject, whom he clearly admires, is commendable, his attraction to Khodorkovsky’s story in particular remains elusive. Although the film has long, engaging stretches, there is something slightly unsatisfying about the whole. It leaves open the question of whether Gibney couldn’t figure out his subject — or whether the filmmaker, who says he began “Citizen K” because this is a time “when we all seem haunted by Russia’s role in the world,” never quite found his focus.",0
"Tesla’s recent performance has given confidence to analysts like Mr. Selesky, whose longer-term target price for the stock is $556. Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer is among the more optimistic Tesla analysts, having raised his 12-to-18-month target stock price this month to $612.",0

"But the F.B.I. has been bruised by Mr. Trump’s unsubstantiated complaints that former officials plotted to undercut his presidency and by a major inspector general’s report last month that revealed serious errors with aspects of the Russia investigation. A broad bipartisan consensus among lawmakers allowing the bureau to broaden its surveillance authorities is most likely elusive, though some lawmakers singled out Apple for its refusal to change its stance.",0
"Granted, that switch in the House majority wasn’t a referendum on Trump’s interactions with Ukraine, which were the grounds for his impeachment and hadn’t yet come to light. But they were absolutely a referendum, in part, on his behavior and character. Lawmakers who are now assessing and acting on the worst of that behavior and character are hardly turning a deaf ear to voters.",0
"Yet at the National Museum of Qatar (designed by the architect Jean Nouvel, who also designed the two-year-old Louvre Abu Dhabi) the crowds are thin, the rooms are quiet and rich with history and there are mercifully far fewer selfie sticks, for the most part. The museum opened in March, and it is what subsequent galleries should be measured by. It is not a trophy case of artwork obtained by rich sultans or kings but a museum that truly charts the nation, tracing its origins from a no man’s land to its Bedouin and pearl fishing history and then to its post-oil transformation to one of the richest countries in the world.",0

"After a loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, Irving told reporters that the gap in talent between championship contenders and the Nets was “glaring, in terms of the pieces that we need in order to be at that next level.” He would go on to list several players who he suggested were a part of the championship core.

"In the wild, even a small genetic change almost always incurs what scientists call a fitness cost: Either an engineered insect won’t be as hardy as its wild peers or it won’t be an attractive mate. (Simply changing the fur color of a fruit fly from brown to yellow, as Gantz did, for instance, reduces its chance of mating by 99 percent.) More radical changes, like creating a mosquito that produces only male offspring, are likely to face even more resistance. Nature is good at circumventing anything that thwarts procreation.",0

"It’s also important for physicians to help patients fully explore the risks and benefits of all available options to mitigate future regret. Assuming it’s not a medical emergency, doctors should, for example, encourage patients to consider how their decisions may vary in “hot” versus “cold” emotional states. As Dr. Jerome Groopman and Dr. Pamela Hartzband explore in the New England Journal of Medicine, when we’re in a “hot” state of mind — when we’re scared or hurting — we’ll do anything to fix the problem. We discount risks, overestimate the benefits, and pursue paths we otherwise might not. In “cold” states, by contrast, we misjudge how much our preferences can change over time and, subject to the pull of inertia, forgo treatments we later wish we’d had. By actively envisioning how things could unfold in both scenarios, however, we can minimize the regret we feel after making tough decisions.",0

"In “Stateway Condo Gentrification,” we learn that Stateway Gardens is “the biggest concrete building on Chicago’s South Side,” as large and imposing as a city itself. The city’s famous wind whistles as it blows past the buildings, and rats slip through the cracks. “Our buildings were painted this grayish-white color that looked like dirty sheets bleached repeatedly,” Tracy tells us. “The only things that gave them color were the frequent sprays of neon graffiti or someone using one of the walls as a toilet.” In the other stories, there’s no shortage of life within and around the apartments: Tracy’s mother washing his hair in between bouts of depression (“Reaganomics, Left Lying in the Road”), the brothers’ near-fatal adventures on a train platform (“Wet Paper Grass”), Jacob’s neighbor-girlfriend’s pregnancy, which he inelegantly asks her to terminate (“Shifts”). But in “Stateway Condo Gentrification” Drain zooms out, giving us a 360-degree rendering of the housing project. It allows the reader to stop and look around, to take stock of all that came before. The particular choices the characters have made are their own, but they are also part and parcel of the urban neglect and decay that plague a place like Stateway.",0

At first, he tended toward the elaborate (oxtail stew, for example); “I was super ambitious and wanting to try everything,” he says. Now, though, he’s getting back to the basics. Take his garlic fried shrimp: it’s a dish he came up with while entertaining at his house on the North Fork of Long Island. He was looking for something that was easy, festive and compatible with beer. The result is a shatteringly crisp plate of shrimp (leave those skins on!) tossed with garlic salt, cilantro and lime juice. It may not be summer, but this dish might transport you, just for a second, to a breezy patio somewhere on Long Island. Watch Lim make it, and talk more about his kitchen, in the video above.",0

"JUST KIDDING: ‘JUNGLE BOOK’ at Symphony Space (Jan. 11, 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.). Many young people have encountered Mowgli, Rudyard Kipling’s boy hero of the wild, in one guise or another, but probably not in the form he takes in this stage production: that of a 25-year-old architect in contemporary New York. He doesn’t dwell in that world for long, however. After receiving a birthday text message that reminds him of his childhood, Mowgli consults his old journal — a personal “jungle book” — and returns to the adventures he had long ago with animals like Baloo, the bear; Bagheera, the panther; and the nurturing wolves. Written and directed by Craig Francis and Rick Miller and recommended for children 5 and older, this adaptation uses elaborate puppetry, shadow play, masks, video projections and immersive sound and music to recreate the Indian landscape and its residents. The hourlong play, which is presented by Kidoons and WYRD Productions, also explores the nature of identity and the threat of bullying, as Mowgli confronts not only the rapacious tiger, Shere Khan, but also a menacing human hunter.",0

Some concessions to the United States — for example, Mr. López Obrador doing Mr. Trump’s dirty work on migration at Mexico’s southern and northern borders — are clearly excessive. Still, even Mr. López Obrador has opted not to cross Mr. Trump’s supposed red line in Mexico: no Cuban doctors in the country, and no subsidized Mexican oil for Cuba. For Argentina, defending a lost cause in Bolivia, where few principles are involved, and helping Cuba and Venezuela perpetuate the misery of their people at the cost of American support where it really counts are simply not worth it.",0

"Key to those protections are two principles established by Congress and enforced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), where I was secretary under President Barack Obama. The first is “disparate impact,” which makes clear that policies or practices that discriminate against people of color or other protected groups are illegal even without proof they are intentional. For example, if white couples are regularly approved for mortgages but black couples with the same qualifications are rejected, the bank must fix their loan process, even if its employees didn’t have racist intentions.

"By the same token, is the misery of the Syrian refugees in Azraq really a failure of central planning? Or is it, rather, a failure to care about the refugees’ well-being? The reason life is better in Zaatari than in Azraq turns out to be that in disorganized Zaatari it’s much easier to pass along unwanted products to smugglers in exchange for cash. The actual lesson here, however, isn’t that refugee camps should be disorganized but that aid agencies should trust refugees with money rather than rely on a condescending system of segregated accounts. Similarly, according to Davies’s own reporting, the teak problem in Panama is less one of unintended consequences than of malfeasance — “the biggest logging firms are owned by serving politicians, and Panama now sells citizenship to anyone willing to invest $80,000 in a teak plantation.”",0

But as a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, he brings military credentials that could play a critical role in the trial as Democrats make the case that Mr. Trump withheld $391 million in military aid in an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Mr. Crow was one of seven freshmen from conservative-leaning districts — all military veterans or former intelligence analysts — who wrote an op-ed in September urging Congress to impeach Mr. Trump if the accusations involving military aid were true. Many saw the piece as a crucial development that showed that Democratic lawmakers had enough backing — including among their politically vulnerable colleagues — to press ahead and open an impeachment inquiry into the president. Mr. Crow, who is 40 and a lawyer, flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018.",0
"If past is prologue, deployment of the systems is going to take place well before their ramifications are fully understood. By 1950, as the Chinese Army was overrunning American and South Korean forces, the Truman administration had already grasped the dilemmas intrinsic to nuclear weapons; the Soviet detonation of a hydrogen bomb a few years later drove the lesson home. But between the exuberance of acquiring a new military capability and the sobering realization of its dangers, there is plenty of opportunity to use them.",0

"It was a five-setter that was more epic in length than mood, with Thiem failing to push Djokovic for long at the end of the fourth set or the fifth. The suspense never approached the high-anxiety levels of last year’s Wimbledon final, when Djokovic beat Federer in a tiebreaker after they won 12 games each in the fifth set, a first for a Wimbledon final. Sunday’s duel also fell short of the five-set United States Open final in September, when Daniil Medvedev, 23, rallied from two sets down to push Nadal remarkably close to his physical limits.",0

"The G.A.O. decision addresses a rather narrow appropriations law issue. In short, what the president did here was precisely the type of adventurism the Impoundment Control Act was designed to prevent. The O.M.B. had no authority to withhold the funds because the act permits it only under specific circumstances — and in this instance, those weren’t met. The O.M.B. argued that the funds were withheld because doing so was necessary to ensure that they were not spent “in a manner that could conflict with the president’s foreign policy.” But the G.A.O. decided the withholding was an “impermissible policy deferral.”",0

Notionally, it follows Swift over the past two years as she comes into her own politically, and begins to pivot away from the vindictiveness of the “Reputation” era back toward the more familiar modes she deployed on “Lover.” But it also flashes back to earlier traumas — it’s not sure whether it’s trying to be an origin story, or a ride-along.

Edna’s awakening begins outdoors, an escape from the structures of patriarchy into the unbuilt landscapes of the sensual, sublime and the supernatural.

"THE IMAGE BOOK (2019) Stream on Mubi. Rent on iTunes, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. This Jean-Luc Godard’ feature has sometimes been referred to as a cinematic essay rather than a film because it largely lacks the hallmarks of a traditional movie. But for this French New Wave contrarian, the true identity of cinema has yet to be discovered, much less fulfilled. The film, which won a Special Palme d’Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, focuses on the ways in which he thinks the Middle East has been insufficiently depicted in film and the media. If the form in which Godard conducts his investigation (a multidimensional assemblage of film clips, video, quotations and complex soundscapes) is baffling, this only reinforces his central point: We have much more to learn about what it means to see.",0

"Some people unwittingly help atrocities occur by cooperating in an attempt to mitigate a monstrous situation. History demonstrates that this is nearly always a miscalculation. During the Holocaust, Jewish councils organized life in the ghetto and compiled lists of Jews for deportation, often thinking that they were helping Jews manage a nightmare. Ultimately, they helped the Nazis murder Jews by maintaining order and providing the Gestapo with the names of people to be deported and murdered. In his memoir, “Legislating the Holocaust,” Bernhard Lösener, a lawyer in the Third Reich’s Ministry of the Interior, relays how he hurriedly traveled through the night to get to Nuremberg in time to write the Nuremberg race laws so that the rule of law would be preserved, and how he fought to have the race laws written to count as Jewish those with three Jewish grandparents rather than those with one drop of Jewish blood. He too made the mistake of participating in the atrocity in an attempt to minimize the damages caused by its perpetrators.",0

"Draw closer, and it becomes clear that much of the power of these works comes from their smart, eccentric construction. Rather than glue, discreet staples hold the images’ brightly painted cutout elements together, without flattening them. The different layers of paper have breathing room — actual space between them. Some even cast shadows that serendipitously enhance the black outlines. Interestingly, Mr. Krushenick rarely exhibited his collages in New York. You wonder if he suspected that these tough little rehearsals might outshine the finished product.",0
"As the coronavirus has spread, Beijing officials have taken a heavier hand to control prices. For example, the government in Baoding, in the central province of Hebei, fined a shopping mall company nearly $300,000 for selling cabbages and cauliflowers at higher prices. Of course, China is hardly alone in punishing price gouging, and it won public praise for fining some pharmacies for raising prices of face masks, which are in short supply all over China.",0
"Mostly, fellow mayors from the population-100,000-or-so set have landed on a kind of grudging respect for the brazenness of the gambit. They did not know that this sort of mega-promotion was available. And, in some cases, they are not entirely sure that it should be.",0
The main appeal of implosion was that it drastically reduced the amount of bomb fuel needed. The dense metals were hard to obtain and far more valuable than gold. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were roughly equal in destructiveness — but fuel for the Nagasaki bomb weighed just 14 pounds — one-tenth the weight of the fuel for the Hiroshima bomb. The secret of implosion thus represented the future of atomic weaponry.,0

"In his manuscript, Mr. Bolton describes an effort that he had made, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, to push Mr. Trump to release the aid. Mr. Bolton said he also spoke with Attorney General William P. Barr about his concerns over the parallel diplomacy with Ukraine led by the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.

"How do these oddsmakers decide the numbers and proposition bets for big games like the Super Bowl? Why do the sports books nearly always end up ahead? What is “square money” and why is it that “the flood of square money that inundates the Super Bowl makes the game one of the easiest lines of the year for oddsmakers”?

"“Why We Can’t Sleep” grew out of an article for O Magazine that went viral, so perhaps it’s facile to say that it reads like a book that grew out of an article. Calhoun alternates among citing statistics and studies; interviewing experts and an assortment of Gen X women, including her friends; and relaying her own experiences. The results of this format are mixed. Some statistics feel cherry-picked or just hard to prove — are Gen X women really more dissatisfied with their marriages than boomers? — and at times, as in the chapter on perimenopause, being Gen X, being female and being middle-aged seem to get conflated. By contrast, the economic and labor statistics are both convincing and sobering.",0

"I wandered into a bookstore in Newburyport, Mass., on a “sick day” from work I hated in 1986. Poking through the stacks, I alighted on “An Unknown Woman,” by Alice Koller, a memoir of her winter spent on Cape Cod deconstructing her life and personality.

Three faces graced the cover of the original pamphlet, also penciled in shades of black and gray. Ms. Fazlalizadeh seems to offer both a reminder and an update. Whereas the original women looked like variations on the stereotypical “career woman,” the new figures suggest different socioeconomic backgrounds and generations. They may be symbols still, but they appear more real and, despite their scale, more intimate. They carry their history with them and yet choose to forge ahead.",0

"There are many reasons for the smaller growth of home market values in heavily minority low-income neighborhoods than in higher-income neighborhoods over the last quarter-century, many of them rooted in the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow. But one cause is more recent: During the lead-up to the financial meltdown of 2008, black and Hispanic homeowners were targeted by mortgage sales firms to refinance properties with new loans that had enticingly low initial interest rates. But the rates exploded into much higher charges a few years later, a result described in the small print of loan documents but one that salespeople rarely highlighted. These “subprime” loans were often marketed to minority homeowners who were fully qualified for mortgage terms like those offered to white suburban homeowners. When the subprime rates escalated, many borrowers were unable to make their monthly payments, and banks foreclosed on their homes. Banks and other mortgage holders boarded up the foreclosed properties, and often failed to mow the lawns or otherwise maintain them in good condition. The eyesores drove market values down for surrounding properties as well.",0

The humanity of the story, it seemed to her, was crucial for exerting pressure on the government. She began to weigh her assets.

"The far right’s rise ultimately emerges from a crisis of the political center. Politicians tasked with stabilizing the Continent after the global financial crash of 2007-08 became adept at turning the political narrative away from their own culpability.

"Warhol’s 35-millimeter pictures have been described as “rigorously amateurish,” unrelenting as a diaristic record, yet consistent in the absence of technical craft and expertise.

For instance, laws that would make it easier for regulators to police the cosmetics industry and to hold medical device companies to account have been floating through Congress for years.

The F.D.A.’s decisions used to be final, but for decades now they have been subject to layers of political interference. Making the agency independent, as the Federal Reserve and the Social Security Administration are, could help reverse that trend.",0
"ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD (2017) 6 p.m. on FXX. It was an alley-oop heard around the film world: Weeks before this historical thriller was released, Ridley Scott enlisted Christopher Plummer to take over the role of J. Paul Getty, replacing Kevin Spacey after Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct. (“At my age, which is enormous, you get worried that your memory won’t hold up,” Plummer said in an interview with The Times in 2017, discussing how he felt when Scott approached him with the challenge. “But this was too damn good to pass up.”) The movie offers plenty of drama in front of the camera, too: It focuses on the 1973 kidnapping of Getty’s 16-year-old grandson, John Paul Getty III. The recovery involves the efforts of the younger Getty’s mother (Michelle Williams) and a former C.I.A. operative (Mark Wahlberg).",0

Five thousand Jews died this way, among them Rae’s older sister, Esther Kushner.",0
"The book’s title refers to a 1978 study in which researchers were trying to establish the relationship between high cholesterol and heart health. Here rabbits were fed a very high fat diet in an effort to mimic human heart problems. The rabbits did, in fact, get a host of heart problems — except for the rabbits under the care of one researcher who cuddled and talked to them while they were fed. The differences in health were so marked that the study was replicated, with the only difference in rabbit care being some extreme petting and cooing; and the results were the same.",0
"The hologram itself has an uneasy pallor, a brighter shade than the humans onstage but at the same time insubstantial, like a ghost struggling to fully materialize. One crucial decision that had faced the animators was choosing the right age for their creation. Dio in his MTV-era prime tempted them, of course, but then wouldn’t it be strange to watch him perform alongside band members who were roughed up by the ensuing years like the rest of us? Then again, Dio’s actual age in 2019, were he alive, would be 77, which is not ideal for a heavy-metal frontman. The creative team ultimately settled on a spry, middle-aged Dio, outfitting him in black leather pants, a studded leather wristband and a bell-sleeved white tunic embossed with a silver cross.",0

But it’s really a question of who government works for and this notion that if you go back to the 1930s, ’40s, ’50s, ’70s, the government worked for the people and it stood up to the big corporations. At least that was the big core belief. It wasn’t perfect and didn’t happen all the time but that was the basic direction.",0
"“I’m a Democrat,” said Mr. Biden, who moments earlier had told reporters at a Dairy Queen here that the contrasts between himself and his top rivals were “self-evident.” Asked to elaborate, Mr. Biden swiped at Mr. Sanders, who represents Vermont as an independent in the Senate.  “Well, he says he’s not. He says — you know, he’s not registered as a Democrat, to the best of my knowledge. And Bernie has a different view.”",0
"For what it’s worth, the crowd at the Zappa concert seemed utterly charmed — cheering when the hologram Zappa materialized in the center of the stage during the opening number, “Cosmik Debris.” I was sitting about eight rows from the front. It looked like Zappa up there, more or less, though his form radiated the paranormal brightness that holograms can’t help emitting. Eventually, “Frank” addressed the audience: “Good evening. You won’t believe it, but I’m as happy to see you guys as you are to see the show. I’m your resident buffoon, and my name is Frank.” The artificiality of the canned banter had a “Weekend at Bernie’s” aspect to it, making me hyperaware of the sunglasses covering the lifeless eyes of the corpse propped up between living people (in this case, a hot backing band composed predominantly of musicians who had toured with Zappa over the years).",0

For 10 years, I wrote for The Economist, and for 34 years I have been a member of the Reform Club in London. There were many journeys (from Cornwall to the Outer Hebrides), a few books and radio programs, a dozen great English friends — all of whom voted Remain, of course — and an O.B.E. (Order of the British Empire), which Queen Elizabeth graciously bestowed upon me in 2001, for explaining the British to the Italians and vice versa (not difficult, Your Majesty: We used to like each other).",0

"LORD OF ALL THE DEAD: A Nonfiction Novel, by Javier Cercas. Translated by Anne McLean. (Knopf, $26.95.) The noted Spanish journalist uses the story of his own family’s dead Falangist “hero” to probe wounds that still fester long after the end of the Spanish Civil War, in a book that flips the script of his earlier novel “Soldiers of Salamis.” Our reviewer, John Hooper, writes that “Cercas gives himself some postmodern leeway in this narrative, every so often speculating on how, if he were to throw off all pretense of not being a novelist, he would fill in the gaps in his story. But his reconstructions are tied pretty closely to known historical fact, and there’s no question but that he invested a staggering amount of time and effort in digging up what little there was to be known.”",0

This proves to be only a minor issue, as the family’s inability to communicate with each other is much harder to overcome than Flor’s language barrier. As she settles in, Flor proves to be an indispensable member of the family who teaches the Claskys more about understanding one another than they could have imagined.",0
"Best-picture contenders typically have the edge over tentpole fare in this category, so while “The Lion King” certainly boasts the most effects, the ultimate contest should come down to “The Irishman” and its de-aging technology vs. the more seamless wartime enhancements of “1917.” Since Robert De Niro’s youthful C.G.I. makeover came in for some criticism, I suspect voters will choose “1917.”",0

On the rare occasion that the board awarded parole, its decision was almost always reversed by the governor.

"Large riots in the name of greater autonomy and religious freedom rocked Xinjiang in the 1990s, and the government responded with brute military force. After Sept. 11, the Chinese government purposely conflated Uighur-rights activists with jihadists, lobbying the Bush administration to designate the little-known East Turkestan Islamic Movement as a terrorist organization, laying the foundation for the state narrative that Uighurs were Muslim extremists. The United States agreed, possibly in exchange for China’s support of the war in Afghanistan. Later, it would be questioned whether the group existed at all.",0

"Madrick’s idea is essentially a subset of universal basic income, a concept championed by an increasing number of prominent Americans — from the presidential candidate Andrew Yang to the conservative social scientist Charles Murray and the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Madrick, a veteran journalist and economic analyst, imagines a government-funded allowance to families that would equal $4,000 to $5,000 per child each year. Every family with children would get some money, which would avoid the problem of only offering the stipend to the guardians of poor youth. After all, there are millions of “near poor” and struggling middle-class families as well, trying to pay for their kids out of stagnant incomes. (According to current guidelines, a family of four living on $25,750 or less qualifies as poor; realistically, Madrick argues, the number should be closer to $50,000.) In addition, he would have the allowance ladled out according to a principle of “non-paternalism”; in other words, it would be unconditional, like love.",0

That there currently is no comprehensive database of heart beats or gaits doesn’t make the technologies that gather them any less effective. And most of the time, it doesn’t matter if identification isn’t tied to a real name. What’s important is that we can be consistently identified over time. We might be completely anonymous in a system that uses unique cookies to track us as we browse the internet, but the same process of correlation and discrimination still occurs. It’s the same with faces; we can be tracked as we move around a store or shopping mall, even if that tracking isn’t tied to a specific name. And that anonymity is fragile: If we ever order something online with a credit card, or purchase something with a credit card in a store, then suddenly our real names are attached to what was anonymous tracking information.",0

(Nadia, it should go without saying, is also tight with Farran.) At one point, Nadia asks Farran how he knows Alan. He tells her that they worked together at a cannery in Alaska. When she expresses surprise, he clarifies that he was kidding.",0

"It’s just a matter of contacting as many people as you know. Our agents and managers that were involved were basically like: “Hey, we have a story about a gay man from Syria. We really need writers who relate to that kind of experience. Do you know anybody like that?” And we ended up having a lot of writers who it was their first job writing for TV. There are tremendously talented people from all parts of the world who haven’t gotten a chance to build a resume yet. They can be hard to find, but to use that as an excuse for why you don’t have different voices in a writers’ room is absurd.",0

"It is edifying to see a show of Warhol photographs isolated from the rest of his work, a compelling counterpoint to the monumental Warhol retrospective at the Whitney last year. The language of photography resides at the core of his practice. In fact, the photographic image was always hiding in plain sight throughout Warhol’s work, from the photo booth images he made as the basis for his early silk-screen portraits to the found press pictures of “Marilyn,” “Jackie” and “Liz’’ layered with colored inks on canvas, and the newspaper pictures at the foundation of his death and disaster paintings. He was fascinated by the optical clarity of the mechanical eye, even as he exploited photography’s role as a documentary requisite for fame.",0

I had privately questioned the motive for going into Iraq, suspicious of the way the administration had shifted its justification over time, but I still chose to go. Secretary of State Colin Powell’s now-notorious United Nations speech on Feb. 5, 2003 — when he argued that Saddam Hussein’s regime had developed weapons of mass destruction and posed an imminent threat — assuaged any reservations I might have had. “Every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources,” he said. “These are not assertions.

He’d look great beside one of our handsome Ryans (Gosling or Reynolds); a friendship with Mike Myers could be very “groovy, baby” indeed; Elon Musk and Grimes, two deeply cursed Canadians, will be parents soon … Might Archie enjoy a play date with little Quant? Celine Dion is unfortunately on tour, though Drake comes home often, and Rachel McAdams lives up north, too. Failing these, my mother lives on a street where “Suits” used to film, which, as far as I can tell from her stories about it, puts her rank on set somewhere near or above executive producer.

I was horrified. There had been little to stop me from harming my interviewee there, but doing so would have required moral bankruptcy. The actions of the guards at Abu Ghraib invalidated the American idea of liberation that I believed in. To me, the cruelty and abuse of power represented a perversion of American values.",0

"We know the answer. In Virginia and many of the 30 other states that allow open carry, Americans have a right to mass, armed protest. But that right, and the right to bear arms in general, is informed by the settler history of the American nation and structured by hierarchies of race and gender, despite our collective pretense to universalism.

"James Morgan is a slight man who pulses with hummingbird energy. He speaks in a rapid patter, often looping back to correct or expand what he has said, adding bits of reflection and analysis gleaned from his years of participating in, and eventually leading, prison self-help groups. But his restless and voluble nature was barely visible as his parole hearing came to order at 8:35 a.m. on that April day. He sat beside Strauss on one side of a bank of tables in the prison hearing room, an informal chamber with linoleum floors, blond-wood-paneled walls and an acoustic tile ceiling. He was completely still, his prison-issue jeans neatly pressed, a white thermal undershirt covering the gang tattoos scrawled across his arms and torso.

"The company’s sourcing narrative, the root of its brand identity, only adds to the business’s complexity. Sweetgreen is part of a small cohort of fast-casual restaurants, like Dig, Tender Greens and Mendocino Farms, for which supporting sustainable agriculture, and buying from small, local producers, is a core tenet. (It is by far the largest of this group, with the most funding.) To enter a new market, Sweetgreen sends a team almost a year in advance to build a roster of local farmers and artisans. That supply chain will not enjoy the same efficiencies as most any other fast food player. “If you’re McDonald’s, it’s easy to achieve economies of scale,” said Youngme Moon, a professor at Harvard Business School and a member of Sweetgreen’s board of directors. “When you’re trying to do something with local farmers, real food, fresh food, it’s a really different proposition. Is there a way to construct a business that’s able to grow and serve lots and lots of people, but is still able to hang on to the food-related values that made them start the business to begin with? That’s what they’re trying to unlock right now.”",0

"It is difficult to know whether this attitude reflects President Trump’s position or only that of his National Security Council officer in charge of Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone, a Cuban-American hard-liner. He was to represent the United States at Mr. Fernández’s inauguration but declined to attend after learning that a high-level Venezuelan official would also be attending. The challenge for Mr. Fernández, and to a lesser extent for President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, is that even if Mr. Trump is not fully managing policy toward the region, consumed as he most likely is with Iran and impeachment, lower-level officials can complicate matters for countries like Argentina and Mexico.",0
Anyone who has witnessed the past decade of American politics cannot be surprised by how destabilizing this demographic change was in the 1850s. Progressives — and Republicans then were the more progressive party — confidently expected that population changes would help them win without having to compromise with conservatives. Conservatives — who then were proslavery Democrats — vowed to wreck the system if they could not reinforce it against the change they dreaded.,0
"Whistler’s night life is lively for a ski village, with the kind of pumping bass, surly bouncers and long lines of a city club scene.

"STAR TREK: PICARD Stream on CBS All Access. “Tea, Earl Grey, decaf.” That’s Jean-Luc Picard’s new beverage order in “Picard,” the latest “Star Trek” TV series and a return to the franchise for Patrick Stewart, who plays the title character. (For those not hip enough for “Star Trek” references: The order used to be “tea, Earl Grey, hot.”) The new show finds Picard — the erstwhile commander of the famous fictional starship known as the Enterprise — in reflective form, grappling with the past as an aged version of himself. It has a starry showrunner in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon, who will presumably bring a new kind of energy to the franchise. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stewart said he was drawn to the new story because it explored “the profound psychological differences in the character, who felt abandoned, distrusted and unnecessary.” Stewart asked, “Where is he now? What matters to him? What control does he have over his life? Very little, as it turned out.”",0

For example, two days ago, we did the final scene and I was not able to sing the last “Mimì.” I told it to [the conductor, Marco] Armiliato: If you can’t hear the “Mimì,” it’s because in that moment, it’s too difficult for me.",0

In person, M.B.Z. speaks deliberately and quietly, lapsing now and then into a crooked grin that conveys a surprising impression of shyness. He has a prominent nose and slightly hooded eyes, partly concealed when I met him by a pair of clunky black-plastic glasses. He speaks fluent English with a faint British accent and an American vocabulary.",0

"When Dr. Brenner, now an executive with UnitedHealth Group, started the Camden Coalition, the answer seemed more straightforward. Camden was one of the nation’s poorest cities, and by identifying those patients who were in and out of the hospital, he saw firsthand how chaotic and disjointed their care was.

"News reporters covering the primary are on myriad email lists that pump out candidates’ schedules, but you don’t need to contact a dozen or so campaigns to know where to head after your morning ski. Instead, you can go to the website of the New Hampshire Union-Leader newspaper, whose onetime publisher, William Loeb (when the paper was called the Manchester Union-Leader), once was the scourge of Democratic candidates and is credited for prompting Senator Edmund S.

Francis Cox (1752-1834) was at various times a linen draper and a brush maker. Simon Murphy has boiled this down to a pair of slender, hymnal-like volumes whose effect is indescribably peculiar, like the radically atemporal reception of … a newsfeed?

Here, six artists — Cai Guo-Qiang, Paul Chan, Richard Prince, Julie Mehretu, Carrie Mae Weems and Jenny Holzer — guided by specific themes, have chosen, which multiplies the impact accordingly. With one per ramp, each selection turns the museum inside out. The combination sustains multiple visits; the concept should be applied regularly. (Smith)",0

"The violence of the subject matter is indisputable. Just as Lindbergh was when he flew with Kenney’s aces, I was shocked by the wanton brutality of both the Japanese and the Americans in combat in New Guinea: the dismemberment of prisoners, the looting of bodies for souvenirs.

"Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said he planned to introduce a resolution on Monday that would amend the Senate impeachment rules to allow the chamber to dismiss the House’s charges if Democrats did not promptly bring them to trial.

Along the way, it missed one opportunity after another to extricate itself from the Trump relationship or at least slow its expansion.

Here is a departure from “Generation”: In the show, Starfleet is often painted as an unflinching force for good. The notion that it would not help save the inhabitants of an entire planet from being wiped out would be unthinkable, enemy or not. (The precedent here is “Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,” when there was much internal grumbling about Starfleet’s trying to negotiate peace with the Klingons, who were also about to die out.)",0

Napolitano became obsessed, not only by the story, but by social media’s fascination with it, so much so that she ended up spending the next eight years writing a fictionalized version set in the United States.

"★ ‘THE GREAT HALL COMMISSION: KENT MONKMAN, MISTIKOSIWAK (WOODEN BOAT PEOPLE)’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through April 9). The second in a series of contemporary works sponsored by the Met consists of two monumental new paintings by the Canadian artist Kent Monkman, installed inside the museum’s main entrance. Each measuring almost 11 by 22 feet, the pictures are narratives inspired by a Euro-American tradition of history painting but entirely present-tense and polemical in theme. Monkman, 54, a Canadian artist of mixed Cree and Irish heritage, makes the colonial violence done to North America’s first peoples his central subject but, crucially, flips the cliché of Native American victimhood on its head. In these paintings, Indigenous peoples are immigrant-welcoming rescuers, led by the heroic figure of Monkman’s alter ego, the gender-fluid tribal leader Miss Chief Eagle Testickle, avatar of the global future that will see humankind moving beyond the wars of identity — racial, sexual, political — in which it is now fatefully immersed.

They said that Qandeel was scared of her brothers and feared their reaction to the kind of work that she was doing. Azeem told a reporter that his daughter had confided in him about this, saying, “Baba, sometimes I feel my younger brother wants to kill me.”",0
"It also showed policies on which everyone’s supporters mostly agree. Supporters of all the candidates give the president a low approval rating, disapprove of the military strike that killed the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and believe the president should be removed from office. One policy area where there was less agreement was on whether the United States should withdraw its military forces from the Middle East. Iowans who supported Mr. Sanders were the most in favor of the withdrawal, while those of Amy Klobuchar were the most critical.",0

"It is this inherited pattern of racial injustice, and its persisting inequities, that the American state and corporate system began to tackle, in a sustained manner, in the middle of the last century. The ambitious aim of Melvin I. Urofsky’s “The Affirmative Action Puzzle: A Living History From Reconstruction to Today” is a comprehensive account of the nonwhite version of affirmative action. This is a complex and challenging historical task, given that “no other issue divides Americans more.” But Urofsky, by and large, has executed it well. Following the United States Commission on Civil Rights, he defines affirmative action as a program that provides remedy for the historical and continuing discrimination suffered by certain groups; that seeks to bring about equal opportunity; and that specifies which groups are to be protected. Urofsky explores nearly all aspects of the program — its legal, educational, economic, electoral and gender dimensions, from its untitled beginnings during Reconstruction to the present. The one major missing part of the puzzle in his otherwise thorough account is the military, which is unfortunate since, as the  military sociologist Charles Moskos pointed out, “nowhere else in American society has racial integration gone as far or has black achievement been so pronounced.” This deserved a long chapter.",0

To see those in the wild, Libbrecht travels to a small town in northeastern Ontario. “The people there think I’m crazy,” he says.",0
"The Iranian government is indeed our enemy, to an extent that the Hamiltonians in the Obama administration sometimes underestimated, and in that sense Trump’s hawkishness toward the mullahs fits with his Jacksonian approach. But the Tehran regime’s capacity and inclination to cause problems for America also reflect our regional presence, posture and alliances, which mostly exist to advance a kind of mixtape of Hamiltonian and Wilsonian grand strategies — access to Middle Eastern oil, the promotion of democracy and human rights, and regime change in Tehran itself.",0

In a statement through his lawyer, Mr. Bryant said at the time that he believed the encounter was “consensual,” but he added that he had come to understand that she did not see it the same way.

Engaging in what Marxists call “heightening the contradictions,” Caldwell argues that the oppressive imperialism of civil rights laws is not incidental.

"This was not the first time the military overhyped new artillery weapons. The Army’s first generation of artillery cluster shells was born out of the service’s bitter experience facing human wave attacks in the Korean War. A top-secret postwar program at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey raced to create a new generation of weapons it called COFRAM, for Controlled Fragmentation Munition. The idea was to design artillery shells that broke open in midair, dispensing little grenades that exploded in more uniformly sized pieces than earlier munitions did. The key, they found, was to score the inside walls of the grenade body in a crosshatch type of design. (The M67 fragmentation hand grenade still in use today is a direct descendant of the COFRAM program.) By blanketing large areas with smaller munitions, they hoped human wave attacks could be defeated.",0

"Fragmented, as well as brutal, “Perfect Blue” suggests a giallo horror remake of Ingmar Bergman’s “Persona.” It also proved prescient as Mima is trolled by a fake home page created by her sinister admirer.

"He did have an eager, eloquent partner for that approach in the pianist Paul Lewis, with whom Mr. Harding and his Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra collaborated in 2016 on an elegantly passionate version of Brahms’s First Concerto. Mr. Lewis, bringing refinement and delicacy to a Grieg concerto that in some hands can sound brawny, dotted his first-movement cadenza with what felt like vast expanses of emptiness, as if pulling the work a few decades forward, toward Ravel.",0

"Cut to 2016, and McCarthy found his creative reprieve two weeks before the Oscars, when his New York theater friend Brian Yorkey asked him to help out on a new Netflix series “13 Reasons Why.” A surprising follow-up to “Spotlight”?

"His second (and current) defense secretary, Mark Esper, lacks the seasoning and stature of his first, Jim Mattis, who resigned 13 months ago when Trump rejected his pleas and vowed to pull American troops out of Syria.

"But even as Allison bloomed in real time, gaining technical confidence and growing into a professional musician with real ambition and intentionality — a fair distance from the heart-shredding, raw bedroom demos that sent her on this path — she has also spent the last two years adjusting to her role as an employer, a decision maker, an adult with an itinerant lifestyle and a public figure with an expectant, intimately engaged and growing audience. It may go largely unremarked upon, but the life of a moderately successful rock singer, especially these days, can be as managerial as it is glamorous.",0

"The first posthumous single from Mac Miller is “Good News,” which tempers musical whimsy with melancholic wordplay. It’s from a forthcoming album, “Circles,” due next Friday, which Miller had been working on with the producer Jon Brion. (The new album is designed to be the companion piece to Miller’s LP “Swimming,” which he released last year, a month before his death at 26.) Miller raps with a meandering unease: “Good news, good news, good news, that’s all they wanna hear/No, they don’t like it when I’m down.” The tone is heavy, burdened, exhausted. But Miller had an ability to leaven even sentiments as dark as these. “Wake up to the moon, haven’t seen the sun in a while,” he raps, “But I heard that the sky’s still blue.” CARAMANICA",0

Susan Hennessey of Lawfare: “I don’t think people fully grasp the constitutional danger of this moment. If the Senate were to refuse to call relevant witnesses with direct testimony of grave presidential wrongdoing then we can no longer understand impeachment to be a genuine check on executive overreach. … Impeachment is merely a measure of how many members of the president’s party sit in the Senate.”,0
"In a pair of votes whose outcome was never in doubt, the Senate fell well short of the two-thirds margin that would have been needed to remove the 45th president.

In August, Google started including “insights” in its Google Flights travel booking feature, displaying, for example, airfares that were lower than average in green and airfares higher than average in red, for some routes. In the fall, it briefly tested a “low price guarantee” service that promised anyone who booked a flight on Google that it would monitor the fare and pay the difference if the fare dropped before the flight took off. The company said in an email last week that it wasn’t sure if it would run that feature again.",0

"For the most part, though, Hennessey and Wittes characterize earlier presidential overreach as “small potatoes” compared to the conflagrations of the last three years. What makes the current presidency truly unprecedented, they say, is how Trump combines a seething vindictiveness with a total lack of interest in governing. The president’s ire is often triggered by something exceedingly petty — like photographs disproving his fantasies about the crowd size at his inauguration. “The traditional presidency — indeed, the structure of the Constitution,” Hennessey and Wittes observe, “does not account for the president’s caring about something profoundly dumb.”",0

"He is a relatively young man with a seemingly old soul, a brilliant mind coupled with a thoughtful and even-tempered demeanor. He can, and does, call us all to serve our great nation, to mend fences, to think outside of ourselves. The time has come for a new generation of leaders, those who have the vocabulary and the desire to speak about issues like climate change, L.G.B.T.Q.+ rights and racial tensions. Younger leaders can wrap their heads around artificial intelligence, drone technology and the global marketplace in ways most of us cannot. I trust them. — Jody Danforth Root, 51, Indianapolis",0

"What mechanisms — what sorts of evidence, what kinds of narratives — can jolt the brain out of its set patterns of denial, accommodation and adjustment? New forms must be forged; new traps set; new words invented, like “solastalgia,” that sidestep numbing jargon. Artists thinking seriously about depicting the climate crisis join a contentious conversation among scientists and activists who have long been struggling with the “narrative problem” of the climate emergency. How do we write a story with an antagonist when we are the antagonist? Do we have a responsibility to avoid narratives of blame and despair, lest they stoke our sense of hopelessness and passivity? Or is there a value, even a moral imperative, in presenting the threats, as frightening as they are?",0

They are not.” Among the changes she called for then was a “stronger and deeper curriculum in every subject.” Later in that same book, she noted, “It should not be left to every district whether or when to teach science, the arts, civics and history; state curricula should reflect modern scholarship, not religious or local opinion.”",0

And since I’ve written numerous columns, before his election and since, about Trump as geopolitical destabilizer without anything as bad as Obama’s still-unfolding Libya folly yet ensuing, it’s important to stress that the fallout from the Suleimani gambit could be less dramatic than the panicked punditry expects. Indeed, if the dead general was really the Islamic Republic’s Stonewall Jackson, its asymmetric strategy’s indispensable man, then over the long run his death might benefit American interests more than any subsequent escalation hurts them.",0

But unlike her counterparts in the movement, who tend to traffic in hard-edge classicism, Schanelec imbues her movies with an enigmatic logic all their own.

"…[W]hen I think about my most memorable time looking up at the night sky, it has to be when I saw a shooting star for the first time. It was the summer between middle and high school and my friend and I went camping in rural Wisconsin. We slept in hammocks, but eventually the mosquitoes were too much to bear so we got out of our hammocks and decided to sleep inside. However, before going inside, we decided to lay out on the dock and look at the stars. It was so clear, every glowing star was visible, and I could hear the water moving beneath me. All of the sudden, there was movement in the sky, a streak of light, a shooting star. This may seem insignificant, it happens all the time. But this was special to me because after that trip, my friend moved far away, and it was hard for me to deal with. Shooting stars will always remind me of that moment.",0

"“The New Class War” lacks the texture and earth and seduction of real portraiture. Lind derides the “overclass” but doesn’t break any ground in depicting it. When he somewhat outdatedly says the tech industry makes “software” or elite city dwellers employ services like “Fingernail Former,” we get the sense of a man who has read more about the world than actually encountered it. When he says, “The rootedness of most working-class Americans and Europeans in their hometowns and regions is often lamented by the intellectuals of the managerial overclass: Why don’t the lazy losers in heartland communities show some initiative and move to the Bay Area to invent an app, or relocate to London to work in finance?” I realized that Lind was reporting from the inside of his own mind.",0

"James began his presentation with a brief overview of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and Zika. Then he turned cautiously to talking about his own area of scientific expertise: an obscure but powerful invention known as a gene drive. James began by noting that two brown-eyed human parents can sometimes produce a blue-eyed child, though only if both parents carry a copy of the recessive gene. A gene drive, he explained, was a tool that in some species could turn such events into a near certainty. For one thing, it guaranteed that a particular gene would be inherited, even if only one parent had it. And it would automatically insert the chosen gene into both copies of the offspring’s DNA, effectively turning a recessive trait into a dominant one. That alone, James explained, “lets you change the odds, so you get blue eyes 99 percent of the time.”",0

"Popkey’s sentences careen breathlessly as her halting, staccato prose mirrors the “churning” within the narrator’s mind — the pulsing interior dialogue, the em-dash-laden reasoning back and forth with herself. Narrative agency is what interests the author, her manner of parceling out information evoking at times the fragmentary and diaristic sensibilities of Jenny Offill’s “Dept. of Speculation.” Her style also conjures the rambling (and occasionally solipsistic) meditations on self-definition in Sheila Heti’s “How Should a Person Be?,” and aspires to reproduce the rhythm of spoken communication in Linda Rosenkrantz’s 1968 novel-in-dialogue, “Talk.” It reminded me at points of Leslie Jamison’s essay “Grand Unified Theory of Female Pain,” in which she emails some of her female friends asking their thoughts on the subject. Popkey’s novel itself is unabashedly “in conversation” with countless texts, an elliptical engagement that mirrors the web of thoughts reverberating in any one head: A “Works (Not) Cited” section at the end includes easily 100 references, from Renata Adler to an episode of “Mad Men.”",0

"I kept thinking of a line from the journalist Emily Witt’s memoir, “Future Sex,” when a man at an “orgasmic meditation” session asks Witt what she desires. “What I said I desired was to surrender to another person without having to explain what I wanted.” In a recent feature on female artists in The Times Magazine, Rachel Cusk is told by one of her spectacularly successful subjects “that she has absolutely no idea of what her real desires are.” Analysis of a woman’s longing feels sutured into our culture lately. In the abstract, ideas on the subject lurk in the same part of my mind as platitudes about creating “strong female leads” onscreen, and a well-intentioned but preposterous pillowcase that says “Consent Is Sexy,” gifted to me by my undergraduate university. Popkey presents us with a shrewd record of the act of unflinchingly circling these amorphous notions of pain, desire and control, all the while quietly noting their clichéd contrivances in snarky, dark humor. I liked being inside her mind; it felt natural. She doesn’t arrive at a totalizing, liberated endpoint. The most we can do is listen to her story.",0

"Borges, who considered Browne the best prose writer in the English language, described paradise as a library, but paradises are overrated. No library is ever enough and every library is already too much. The principal difference between owning books now and owning books 20 years ago is that, back then, you would pick up some magnificent unexpected book, and you knew that if you didn’t buy it, you might never see it again. What has disappeared is that potential for loss that made ownership necessary. It was like love in wartime. You would see a book and you couldn’t let it go. That is the feeling that the Thomas Browne books give me. I need to possess them because I feel they might go away, that they are in the middle of going away.",0
"“One night, I woke up and heard someone singing outside. It was a man’s voice. I thought to myself that our guard wouldn’t probably notice if I sneaked out to have a look. I went outside and saw a man dressed in a black coat. He was singing and raising his arms in the air. Suddenly I felt someone grabbing my arm. It was a Jewish friend from the ward. She asked me: ‘Do you know what he’s singing?’”",0

"Trump is almost certainly ignorant of the Johnson-Reed Act (Stephen Miller, on the other hand, is not).

Whiteness here is a tragic, symbolic condition. Overlooked, unseen, under-medicated, Joker, and eventually his disciples, discover that being a guy with a carnival-ready white face helps get him the attention he wants. And even though this is the only movie of the bunch (the only non-Korean, Hitler-free movie) to feature even remotely meaningful parts for nonwhite actors (a bunch of Latinos beat up Joker in the opening minutes; his social worker and neighbor are black women), guess what: He kills a lot of them!",0

"Once established, though, the star persona can become a received idea, not just a mask, and tough to dislodge. Pitt’s early success was often framed as a fairy tale about a Missouri kid who “for no apparent reason,” as one writer put it, came to Hollywood and fast became the next big thing. (Cue the James Dean comparisons, of which there were many.) Pitt studied acting in Los Angeles, including with the well-regarded Roy London, but the labor of performing isn’t sexy. It also doesn’t fit with the canard that stars can’t act. But there’s more to acting than the Method, telegraphed anguish and dropping (or adding) pounds, and while Pitt can go big — he’s played Achilles and a serial killer — he has a gift for understatement.",0

"‘IN PURSUIT OF FASHION: THE SANDY SCHREIER COLLECTION’ at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 17). Featuring 80 pieces of clothing and accessories, this exhibition is, more than anything else, the reflection of one woman’s love affair with fashion. Schreier’s collection, and the part of it on view at the Met, contains all the major names, but what defines it more than anything else is her own appreciation for pretty things. Hidden away between the Balenciagas and the Chanels, the Diors and the Adrians, are treasures by little-known or even unknown designers that are a delight to discover. Three origin-unknown flapper dresses from the 1920s, beaded to within an inch of their glittering seams, matched only in their lavish surprise by three elaborately printed velvets of the same era — two capes and a column — by Maria Monaci Gallenga, so plush you can practically stroke the weft with your eyes. It is these less famous names whose impact lingers, in part because they are so unexpected. (Vanessa Friedman)",0

Even a college acting teacher said no one would cast him. “I saw zero representation of transmasculinity,” he says, using an umbrella term that means different things to different people but often describes trans men and nonbinary people who identify more with masculinity. “It was very isolating to grow up and have these dreams.

"In his By the Book (Dec. 22), Mark Morris laments the extent to which he has forgotten the substance of many of the books he has read, contending that he would “fail every attempt to give a book report on just about any one of them.” But I suspect this is true of many omnivorous readers, except perhaps the tiny minority with freakish total recall, a trait that might prove oppressive to live with anyway. Morris cites a long and varied list of authors whose output he has read “most, if not all, of,” and tells us he loved almost all of these works. That he has been capable of deriving such sustained enjoyment from his reading is a vigorous illustration of the power of books to enrich life.",0

My typical breakfast would be eggs, veggies and turkey bacon. You can be healthy but not harp about it.",0
"The women slugging it out at the male-dominated corporate headquarters of Truviv, an athletic apparel brand in Dallas, have two things in common: They’re all mothers and they all move in the dark shadow of their abusive colleague Ames Garrett, who’s about to glide into the suddenly vacated C.E.O. position. Fed up with Ames’s evil ways, the lawyer Sloane Glover adds his name to a “BAD Men” list, then she and her co-workers Ardie Valdez and Grace Stanton file a sexual harassment lawsuit against Ames and Truviv.

"In any case, the book makes a detailed case for how changes to Towne’s version transformed “Chinatown” into a counterintuitive classic. A film whose heroine was supposed to survive became one in which everybody loses. To all of its California sunlight and other noir-flouting design aspects, Polanski brought the deepest of shadows. The production designer Richard Sylbert talks about the film’s palette, which uses parched, arid colors except for when the rich and powerful appear. His sister-in-law Anthea Sylbert, the film’s costume designer, spoke directly to Wasson. She makes a wonderful observation about how the kinds of people who carry one, three or five keys in their pockets are three completely distinct kinds of people. She was one of the many “Chinatown”-era casualties of the new, corporate Hollywood of the mid-1970s.",0
"So far, at least, the process has been rocky. At the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, in November 2018, a coalition of activist groups compared gene drives to the atomic bomb and accused researchers of using malaria as a Trojan horse to cover up the development of agricultural gene drives for corporate profit.

"Experts might decry such preferences as “irrational,” but allowing experts to dictate what people should want is the high road to totalitarianism. There’s a joke that a Communist activist once addressed a group of workers and promised them, “When the revolution comes, you will all eat strawberries and cream!” A worker raised his hand and said, “But I don’t like strawberries and cream.” The Communist immediately replied, in a slightly menacing tone: “When the revolution comes, you will like strawberries and cream.”",0

"The show’s most popular segments are conversations between Bernard and his brother, Orville, who calls in each night after working long hours on the Dig. Framed as a story of “two brothers, struggling to connect through layers of earth,” their talks have such high ratings that the station’s parent company, Sundial Media, wants to monetize them. They offer Orville a generous sum in exchange for weaving advertisements into the flow of his fraternal heart-to-hearts. When Orville refuses on principle, he finds that not only has Sundial contrived to prevent him from making his nightly call-in, they have replaced him with a voice actor, and no one, not even Bernard, is the wiser.",0
"The case could become a new point of contention in a long-running dispute between Apple and the F.B.I. over what digital information should be accessible to law enforcement.

The technology has frustrated law enforcement authorities, who say Apple has given criminals a safe haven.",0

"THE EAST WIND COMMUNITY is hidden deep in the Ozarks of southern Missouri, less than 10 miles from the Arkansas border, surrounded by jagged hills and tawny fields. Getting there requires traversing country roads that rise, dip and twist through chicken-wire-fenced farmsteads and grazing pastures cluttered with rusty agricultural equipment until you reach 1,145 acres of largely undeveloped highland forest, where cedar, oak, pine and mulberry create a dense canopy. Beneath that are 27 buildings and structures, including four large dormitories, nine personal shelters, a kitchen and dining facility, an automobile shop, a nut butter manufacturing plant and a cold-storage warehouse, all built over the years by the community since its founding in 1974.

When our children were younger, we had a saying in our house: Accidents will happen, but stop having so many of them. Same goes with you and the grocery basket. Stop forgetting it. I promise you it will require less effort than conjuring an alternate universe in which your girlfriend is wrong, just to escape the embarrassment you feel for repeatedly making this dumb error. Grab a basket like everyone else on Earth, and free yourself from this shame cycle!",0
"“If you would have seen this place when it was a marsh, a place where people came to fish, you wouldn’t think houses could ever have been built here,” Mr. Ahmetaj said.

"MASTER DRAWINGS NEW YORK at various locations (Jan. 25-Feb. 1). Painting and sculpture often overshadow drawing, or what Roberta Smith, the co-chief art critic of The New York Times, has called “the most intimate of art mediums.” But this annual showcase on the Upper East Side, which takes place at more than 20 locations clustered around Madison Avenue (as well as at Sotheby’s and Christie’s), spotlights works of paper and ink, charcoal or graphite. Among the highlights are Moeller Fine Art’s “The Enchanted World of Lyonel Feininger,” a collection of drawings and painted wooden pieces by that German-American artist, and the reunion of Guercino’s recently rediscovered “Aurora” with its preparatory drawing at Christopher Bishop Fine Art.

"Academy voters sometimes use technical virtuosity — as well as genre and “seriousness” — to rationalize their choices. Genre was invoked as one reason in 2018 more voters didn’t enthusiastically embrace “Get Out,” a discomforting, great horror movie about race in America. (It won best original screenplay.) The next year, the academy gave best picture to “Green Book,” a mediocre movie that sentimentalizes race relations. “Green Book” won because it delivers what Brecht called a mounted messenger, which “guarantees you a truly undisturbed appreciation of even the most intolerable conditions.” That sums up “Jojo Rabbit” too, Taika Waititi’s ostensibly feel-good World War II movie about cute, funny Nazis and this year’s candidate for the academy’s perennial “Life Is Beautiful” slot.",0

"The treating physicians and nurses agreed on the patient’s prognosis, and on a consistent message everyone could support. We met with the family at the young woman’s bedside and later telephoned out-of-state family members. The I.C.U. director and I spoke about difficult medical decisions we’d had to make regarding our own family members, and we asked them what she might want, since they were representing her interests and acting on her behalf.

Yet much of affluent America has shrugged, with elites paying little attention to the disintegration of communities across the country—or, worse, blaming the victims. In fact, plenty of blame could go elsewhere: Politicians, journalists, religious leaders and business executives were too often derelict as communities cratered and tens of millions of people endured the pain.

"One way the elite functions, Lind says, is through the labeling of white-working-class prejudices as phobias — as in transphobia, homophobia, Islamophobia. To call these things “phobias” is, he writes, “to medicalize politics and treat differing viewpoints as evidence of mental and emotional disorders.” Then, outlandishly, he takes it a step further. “If those in today’s West who oppose the dominant consensus of technocratic neoliberalism are in fact emotionally and mentally disturbed, to the point that their maladjustment makes it unsafe to allow them to vote, then to be consistent, neoliberals should support the involuntary confinement, hospitalization and medication of Trump voters and Brexit voters and other populist voters for their own good, as well as the good of society.”",0

"That’s true to some extent, but the thing is, even though the Oscars don’t make the movies, they affect what movies get made. And I think that’s really crucial.

"MIDSOMMAR (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Ari Aster made waves in 2018 with the release of his debut feature, “Hereditary.” A year later, he delivered another haunting watch, “Midsommar.” The protagonists, Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor), are on the verge of breaking up until a family tragedy brings them closer. Not close enough, that is, as Christian is emotionally detached while a grieving Dani clings onto him for comfort. Months later, Christian reluctantly invites Dani to join him and his friends at a festival in a remote Swedish village that occurs every 90 years. The group arrives at the sun-kissed landscape in awe, until they realize they have entered the terrain of a pagan cult. Needless to say, terror ensues. Aster tried to center the horror around Dani and Christian’s deteriorating relationship, yet critics have said their back story was not given enough weight to begin with. Aster’s real strength, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, “is the setup, that part when he lays out his characters, their worlds and the menace that closes on them like a claw.”",0

"In 2018, the curator Francisco Berzunza invited the South African artist Pieter Hugo to Mexico to create a body of work that would engage with themes of sexuality and death for an exhibition at the Centro Fotográfico Manuel Álvarez Bravo. During his monthlong stay, Hugo searched for a response to this prompt, and inspiration came when he chanced upon a platter of desiccated fruits in Oaxaca. “Making Pigments. San Agustin Etla” (2018), which shows a spread of dying crops in bold hues, was the first image Hugo captured in Mexico. But “something shifted” during that first visit, Hugo says. “I don’t know why, but I’m not done here,” he remembers thinking; he has since visited Mexico four more times, traveling between the bustling border city of Tijuana in the north, the colonial town of San Cristóbal de las Casas in the Central Highlands and the indigenous Zapotec town of Juchitán in the southern state of Oaxaca. “From the Day of the Dead to narco-politics, death is strongly felt there,” he says of the country, but it was its people’s day-to-day understanding of life’s fragility that inspired his new photography series, “La Cucaracha,” which will go on display at Yossi Milo Gallery in New York this month.

At best, term limits appeal to the “good government” instincts that gave us referendums and recall elections (incidentally, Steyer wants national referendums as well). But I also think they appeal to our most cynical instincts, to the Trumpian refrain that all politics is a waste and all politicians are crooks and liars. And as with the unintended consequences of term limits, the unintended consequence of that view is to empower actual crooks and actual liars, who don’t care for government or governance and hold the truth itself in contempt.",0

She told me that attempts by the president to steal the Front National’s clothes would be unsuccessful in the long term.

"Figures like Mr. Trump, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary or President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey do indeed criticize elites. But more important, they claim that they, and only they, represent what they often call the “real people.” As a result, they do not just attack other contenders for power as fundamentally illegitimate, they also suggest that all citizens who do not support them are not properly part of the people at all. Mr. Trump does not simply try to refute opposition to his policies, as any normal politician would do; he attacks his critics as “un-American.” Mr. Erdogan says about himself and his political party, “we are the people.” Right-wing populists always wage culture wars with a view to excluding some citizens, symbolically or through actual disenfranchisement. While they incessantly talk about unifying the people, dividing them is actually the very basis of their political business model.",0

"Her departure that day from her fan-barnacled building leads her to ruminate, minutes later, about the toll that level of attention has taken on her psyche. Swift confesses that, for some while, she couldn’t stand to see pictures of herself because she’d scrutinize rather than simply look; the scrutiny spurred an eating disorder. Here’s Swift personalizing the diseased nature of fame, a condition she’s considered with envy and rue in her songwriting, namely on “The Lucky One” from “Red,” a masterpiece album from 2012 that navigates stadium, dance floor and diary.

Nonetheless, I found myself wishing, in my conversations with girls, that their early sexual experiences did not have to be, as they so often were, something they had to get over.

"However, even a lilt can become a drone. Although “Small Days and Nights” succeeds in its first-person narrative (which is more truthful and wholesome than that of any character in Doshi’s previous novel, “The Pleasure Seekers”), by the middle of the book Grace’s listlessness and confusion can become tiresome. Doshi has said she believes that literature allows for “multiple expressions of the same story,” but Grace is too moody and preoccupied to pull this off. In Doshi’s poem “Contract,” which opens her third collection of poetry, she writes about the future: “If it is bleak, I will lie / so that you may live / seized with wonder.” But there are no lies here, and Doshi’s characters are seized with despair.",0
"By the epilogue, when the narrative returns to DiGregorio’s personal story, readers will appreciate how medicine lurches forward with leaps and mishaps along with the inevitably tense discussions about which path to take and when. All doctors wrestle with these issues, yet they seem particularly poignant when we are dealing with tiny babies. That’s because, as DiGregorio puts it, the field of neonatology has “changed the way we understand what it means to be alive, what it means to be human, and what constitutes a life worth living.”",0

If you are short on funds, you may be able to offer other kinds of aid, like helping your parent with home maintenance and repairs, or researching possible financial assistance programs. If emotions run high, it may help to have a neutral person — a lawyer or a financial adviser the family trusts — mediate the discussion to make sure the conversation is constructive.",0

The coaches supported her as well, even though she had no experience, having never even played flag football. But it’s a no-cut team, and players don’t have to try out for a spot.

"It is not clear what, if anything, the Erie museum knew about Mr. Helmer’s work history when it hired him. The museum said it investigated a complaint by Ms. Alkhafaji and found no reason to discipline Mr. Helmer, who still runs the museum today.",0
The coronavirus is another big unknown. China is a major customer for German cars and other European products. A slowdown in China would spill over to the eurozone. Europeans are also nervous that President Trump could follow through on threats to put punitive tariffs on cars manufactured there.,0

"His tiny company, Clearview AI, devised a groundbreaking facial recognition app. You take a picture of a person, upload it and get to see public photos of that person, along with links to where those photos appeared. The system — whose backbone is a database of more than three billion images that Clearview claims to have scraped from Facebook, YouTube, Venmo and millions of other websites — goes far beyond anything ever constructed by the United States government or Silicon Valley giants.",0

"“The concept was about shooting everything in white,” Mr. Valeri said at the time. “That was Ruven’s idea. But I wanted to do something more modern and less conventional and less clichéd. It’s not like, ‘Let’s just put Kobe in a pair of pants and a shirt or in a suit.’”",0

"In a 2018 essay for Time magazine, the actress Gabrielle Union lamented Hollywood’s lack of imagination when it comes to casting people of color. Why, she asked, is it so hard to make movies about black and brown people that tell “the same nonsensical and mundane stories as white women and men”? It’s now two years later, and the only actor of color nominated for an Oscar is Cynthia Erivo for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman.",0
"The conversation that Mr. Bolton describes was separate from another one that Mr. Bolton wrote about, where he observed Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Trump talking on the phone with Mr. Giuliani about Ukraine matters. Mr. Mulvaney has told associates he would leave the room when Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani were talking to preserve their attorney-client privilege, and his lawyer said earlier this week that Mr. Mulvaney was never in meetings with Mr. Giuliani and has “no recollection” of the first discussion.",0

"For Chinese people, who traditionally believe in yin and yang, the notion that rivals can cooperate isn’t a contradiction in terms. It seems to be a problem for America, however. Officials in Washington and other Western capitals have expressed dismay that China hasn’t become more like the United States, or at least more democratic. But did China ever pledge to become like the United States? And so what if it hasn’t become that? Competitive coexistence is still possible.",0

"In a short run, Pugh has shown striking range. Watching her 2019 films back to back — an anti-trilogy of performances as precise as they are irreconcilable — is a disorienting experience. Pugh’s open, heart-shaped face, with a nose and chin that she wields like sharp implements, seems capable of infinite modulation, gliding across a vast spectrum of human emotion as smoothly as turning a dial.",0

"Melissa Lozada-Oliva, a poet who hosts the podcast “Say More” with Gatwood and who said they first bonded over the gaps in their front teeth, said that she knew Gatwood struggled with the book.

"But to all those who follow football — and even those who do not — Manning will forever be best known for producing two of his best games against the kingly New England Patriots in the Super Bowl, the game’s biggest stage. In the first of those contests, the undefeated Patriots were trying to win their 19th consecutive game that season. They led the Giants by 4 points with less than three minutes remaining. With poise and resourcefulness, Manning led the Giants on an 83-yard drive, which included a pivotal but helter-skelter play: He avoided multiple sack attempts and heaved a pass downfield that wide receiver David Tyree caught by pinning the football against his helmet.",0

"Instead, the Costa Chica has developed slowly and organically over decades. Its economy, long based on subsistence farming and fishing, now includes a modest tourism industry. The area is relatively hard to get to (there are no direct international flights), but that — like all the area’s peculiarities — ends up being a strength rather than a weakness. The outsiders who end up on this stretch of Pacific coastline are here for a reason. Beyond its bohemian surf towns, the coast’s evolving culture includes world class art and architecture at Casa Wabi, a sleek, modernist artist’s retreat and exhibition venue designed by the Pritzker award-winning architect Tadao Ando, among others; a small but notable gay community in the town of Zipolite; and the New Agers and yogis at Mazunte.",0
"An American official said diplomats in Baghdad were nervous about the embassy being the target of retaliation, but noted that Iran had many options, and an embassy attack by pro-Iran militias was only one of them. The embassy is among the most fortified American outposts in the world, and there are other less-guarded targets that Iran could choose.",0
"This, of course, was obvious to almost everyone but The Post’s higher-ups. It was impossible to imagine how posting a link to a story by a different publication on Twitter could undermine the work of colleagues. Just as it was impossible to imagine which colleagues would have felt undermined (more than 300 of Ms. Sonmez’s colleagues expressed solidarity with her in a letter from The Post’s union to management).",0
"“I think that’s increasingly what’s on voters’ minds,” Pete Buttigieg, one of the leading candidates in Iowa, said in an interview, referring to electability. “If they’re making up their minds now and still thinking through us, it means they appreciate that we’ve got common values and they want the person most likely to beat Donald Trump.”",0
"Sand, that is, that’s been enriched with large supplements of hype and hubris, then put in the service of greed. That’s the subject of Christopher Knowlton’s “Bubble in the Sun: The Florida Boom of the 1920s and How It Brought On the Great Depression,” which, subtitle notwithstanding, does not remotely make the case that the Florida land boom of the 1920s “brought on the Great Depression.” (Knowlton, in fact, effectively disavows the assertion himself, so I’ll blame an overweening publisher for the misleading subtitle.) But the book does offer a story that, though often told before, is worth the spirited retelling Knowlton brings to it.",0

"“Give the people back their power,” the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, implored a few months ago, arguing against impeachment itself. Referring to the president’s transgression and the November 2020 election, McConnell said, “The American people, if they think this is a very significant episode, can take it into account.” Senator Lindsey Graham chimed in: “I really do believe that the best person — group of people — to pick a president are the voters, not a bunch of partisan politicians.” Pat Cipollone, one of the president’s lawyers, added: “No one ever thought that it would be a good idea for our country — for our children, for our grandchildren — to try to remove a president from a ballot, to deny the American people the right to vote.”",0
"Obtaining a new trial requires more than proving that expert testimony relied on faulty science, however. “You have to show they wouldn’t have been convicted if jurors knew this information,” Ms. Garcia said. “That’s not easy.”",0
